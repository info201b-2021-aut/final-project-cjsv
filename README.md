# Final Project

## Domain of interest

Our domain of interest is biodiversity. We are interested in this domain because biodiversity is an indicator of the effects of climate change. 

Other examples of data driven projects related to this domain are:
- [Biodiversity Conservation in the Amazon](https://biodiversitylinks.org/projects/mission-projects/biodiversity-conservation-program-in-the-amazon)
- [Reduce Opportunities for Unlawful Transport of Endangered Species (ROUTES)](https://biodiversitylinks.org/projects/current-global-projects/routes)
- [Targeting Natural Resource Corruption (TNRC)](https://biodiversitylinks.org/projects/current-global-projects/routes)

The data-driven questions we hope to answer about this domain are:
- What is the biodiversity trend over the last decade?
- Which areas are the most biodiverse and which areas are the least biodiverse?
- How many species have disappeared from certain areas over the last decade?

## Finding Data
We are lucky enough to live in a time when there is lots of publicly available data made possible by governments, journalists, academics, and companies. In this section, you will identify and download at least 3 sources of data related to your domain of interest described above (into a folder you create called data/). You won't be required to use all of these sources, but it will give you practice discovering data. If your data is made available through a Web API, you don't need to download it. For each source of data, provide the following information:

Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
How many observations (rows) are in your data?
How many features (columns) are in the data?
What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?

  - This report was created by a partnership of ten organizations concerned with biodiversity and convservation using data from more than 15,500 bird watchers. It tracks the conservation status of multiple bird species across India. 
  - There are 867 rows. 
  - There are 19 columns. 
  - This dataset can be used to answer questions one and three from above.

  - The Current Invasive Plants (InvasivePlantCurrent) data was collected by the National Invasive Plant Inventory Protocol. It includes most recent and excludes historic observations. 
  - There are 814692 rows.
  - There are 11 columns.
  - This data set can be used to answer all the questions from above.

- [Native Fish Species](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/native-fish-richness-ace-ds2744)

  - The data was collected by California Department of Fish and Wildlife.
  - There are 4473 rows containing the specific places in California with the corresponding number of native fish and statistics regarding land area and shape. 
  - There are 7 columns.
  - This dataset can be used to answer the second question about which speicific area in California is more biodiversed and which is less.
