# Final Project

## Domain of interest

Our domain of interest is biodiversity. We are interested in this domain because biodiversity is an indicator of the effects of climate change. 

Other examples of data driven projects related to this domain are:
- [Biodiversity Conservation in the Amazon](https://biodiversitylinks.org/projects/mission-projects/biodiversity-conservation-program-in-the-amazon)
- [Reduce Opportunities for Unlawful Transport of Endangered Species (ROUTES)](https://biodiversitylinks.org/projects/current-global-projects/routes)
- [Targeting Natural Resource Corruption (TNRC)](https://biodiversitylinks.org/projects/current-global-projects/routes)

The data-driven questions we hope to answer about this domain are:
- What is the biodiversity trend over the last decade?
- Which areas are the most biodiverse and which areas are the least biodiverse?
- How many species have disappeared from certain areas over the last decade?

## Finding Data
We are lucky enough to live in a time when there is lots of publicly available data made possible by governments, journalists, academics, and companies. In this section, you will identify and download at least 3 sources of data related to your domain of interest described above (into a folder you create called data/). You won't be required to use all of these sources, but it will give you practice discovering data. If your data is made available through a Web API, you don't need to download it. For each source of data, provide the following information:


Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
How many observations (rows) are in your data?
How many features (columns) are in the data?
What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
