# Final Project

## Domain of interest

Our domain of interest is biodiversity conservation. We are interested in this domain because we humans are exceeding the one of nine planetary boundaries --biosphere integrity especially genetic biodiversity. It is urgent for us to find as much as information, analyze it, and develop solutions to prevent biodiversity from further reducing and help mitigate the negative impacts. 

Other examples of data driven projects related to this domain are:
- [Biodiversity Conservation in the Amazon](https://biodiversitylinks.org/projects/mission-projects/biodiversity-conservation-program-in-the-amazon)
- [Reduce Opportunities for Unlawful Transport of Endangered Species (ROUTES)](https://biodiversitylinks.org/projects/current-global-projects/routes)
- [Targeting Natural Resource Corruption (TNRC)](https://biodiversitylinks.org/projects/current-global-projects/routes)

The data-driven questions we hope to answer about this domain are:
- What is the status of invasive species in different regions? 
- Which areas are the most biodiverse and which areas are the least biodiverse?
- How many species have disappeared from certain areas over a period of time?

## Finding Data

- [Biodiversity in National Parks](https://www.kaggle.com/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity)
  - Downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
  - The National Park Service species list database is managed and updated by staff at individual national parks and the systemwide Inventory and Monitoring department.
  - There are 119248 rows.
  - There are 13 columns.
  - This dataset can be used to answer all the questions from above. 

- [Current Invasive Plants](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/current-invasive-plants-feature-layer-d6b82)
  - Downloaded from [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
  - The Current Invasive Plants (InvasivePlantCurrent) data was collected by the National Invasive Plant Inventory Protocol. It includes most recent and excludes historic observations. 
  - There are 814692 rows.
  - There are 11 columns.
  - This data set can be used to answer all the questions from above.

- [Native Fish Species](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/native-fish-richness-ace-ds2744)
  - Downloaded from [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
  - The data was collected by California Department of Fish and Wildlife, who used Areas of Conservation Emphasis (ACE) to compile and analyze the best available statewide spatial information in California on biodiversity, rarity and endemism, harvested species, significant habitats, connectivity and wildlife movement, climate vulnerability, climate refugia, and other relevant data. 
  - There are 4473 rows. 
  - There are 7 columns.
  - This dataset can be used to answer question 2, specifically which area in California is more biodiversed and which is less.
